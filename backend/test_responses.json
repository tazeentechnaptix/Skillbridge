      "ai_reasoning": "Here's an analysis of your skills against the job keywords, focusing on fit, gaps, and next steps:\n\n---\n\n### 1) Fit Summary\n\nYou have a **strong technical alignment** with the core requirements of this role. Your skills in `python`, `fastapi`, and general `backend` `engineer`ing directly match the explicit technical keywords.\n\nFurthermore, your `docker` and `postgresql` skills are excellent complementary technologies for a robust backend role. While not explicitly listed in the job keywords, they demonstrate a well-rounded skillset that is highly valuable and often expected in modern backend development environments.\n\n**In essence, your technical toolkit is very well-suited for the technologies mentioned in the job description.**\n\n### 2) Missing Skill Clusters\n\nThe primary gap identified is not in specific technical tools, but rather in the **seniority and experience level** implied by the job keywords.\n\n*   **Seniority & Experience:** The keywords `experienced` and `senior` strongly suggest the role is looking for someone with a proven track record beyond just technical proficiency. This typically includes:\n    *   **Project Leadership:** Leading initiatives, defining scope, and driving projects to completion.\n    *   **Architectural Design:** Contributing to or owning the design of complex systems, considering scalability, reliability, and maintainability.\n    *   **Mentorship & Guidance:** Guiding junior engineers, performing comprehensive code reviews, and elevating team standards.\n    *   **Strategic Thinking:** Understanding business needs and translating them into technical solutions, making trade-offs, and influencing technical direction.\n    *   **Problem Solving at Scale:** Tackling complex, ambiguous problems and delivering robust solutions.\n\nWhile your technical skills are strong, the job description implies a need for demonstrated impact and leadership that goes beyond individual contributions.\n\n### 3) Quick Upskilling Ideas\n\nTo bridge the perceived gap in seniority and experience, focus on demonstrating impact, leadership, and broader system understanding:\n\n1.  **Lead a Project End-to-End (or a Significant Feature):**\n    *   **Action:** Take ownership of a substantial feature or a small project at your current role. Drive it from initial requirements gathering, through design, implementation, testing, and deployment.\n    *   **Focus:** Document your decision-making process, challenges faced, solutions implemented, and the impact (quantifiable if possible). This shows initiative, ownership, and problem-solving.\n\n2.  **Deepen System Design Knowledge:**\n    *   **Action:** Actively study common backend architectural patterns (e.g., microservices, event-driven architectures, caching strategies, load balancing, database scaling).\n    *   **Resource:** Explore resources like \"Grokking the System Design Interview\" or similar books/courses. Practice designing systems for various scenarios. This will equip you to contribute to higher-level architectural discussions.\n\n3.  **Active Mentorship & Code Review:**\n    *"

These questions are designed to assess your hands-on knowledge and how you approach common backend engineering challenges with the tools you've listed.\n\nHere are 12 questions for a junior Backend Engineer candidate:\n\n1.  Explain Python's `async/await` keywords and provide a simple, practical use case within a web API context.\n2.  How do you manage project dependencies and isolate environments in Python? Why is this crucial for backend development?\n3.  Describe your approach to debugging a Python application when an unexpected error occurs. What tools or techniques do you typically use?\n4.  You're building an endpoint to create a new user. How would you use Pydantic for request body validation in FastAPI, and what happens on validation failure?\n5.  How would you integrate a PostgreSQL database with a FastAPI application, specifically managing database sessions or connections efficiently?\n6.  Explain FastAPI's Dependency Injection system. Provide a concrete example of how you'd use it for a common task like authentication or database access.\n7.  Provide a basic `Dockerfile` for a Python FastAPI application, explaining the purpose of each key instruction.\n8.  What is the practical difference between `COPY` and `ADD` in a `Dockerfile`? When would you choose one over the other?\n9.  Your FastAPI application uses a PostgreSQL database running in a Docker container. How do you ensure the database's data persists even if the container is removed or updated?\n10. When and why would you add an index to a"
